# Automatic Warranty retrieval and reporting

See https://www.cyberdrain.com/automating-with-powershell-automating-warranty-information-reporting/ for more information.

This is a PowerShell module that helps you get warranty information for items in your CMDB, PSA, or RMM. This module was made due to some shady businesses going on in the world of Warranty reporting and lookups, and to democtratize the warranty lookups. :)

# Note
At present lookups for HP, Lenovo and Microsoft are not working.
You can bybass these lookups by adding the following switches
    -ExcludeMS
    -ExcludeHP
    -ExcludeLenovo

# Installation instructions

This module has been published to the PowerShell Gallery. Use the following command to install:

    install-module PSWarranty

# Supported Platforms

The following platforms are supported. You can also use a CSV file as a source to generate reports. This won't sync back to the source though. Some APIs don't allow write-back, so those are only available to create reports.

# Usage in products such as PSA or RMMs by vendors/non-MSPs

To use this product inside of your RMM, PSA, or other systems and you are not an MSP you must request a license or be an active [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/KelvinTegelaar) of a specific tier.

# Apple Note

Due to a change in how Apple generates serial numbers it is no longer possible to accurately determine the warranty expiry for newer devices. As such any new Apple devices could return a completely inaccurate expiry date. To account for this you can add the -ExcludeApple switch to the the Update-Warrantyinfo.ps1 script to skip updating any apple devices and ensure you do not update with inaccurate data.

# Usage

## Autotask

To execute an update of all devices in Autotask use:

    $Creds = get-credential
    update-warrantyinfo -Autotask -AutotaskCredentials $creds -AutotaskAPIKey 'APIINTEGRATIONKEY' -SyncWithSource -OverwriteWarranty

This script will then update all devices in Autotask with the date found in the APIs. If they date returned is invalid it will not update. If the date is already filled in, it will overwrite this.

To only generate HTML reports use

    $Creds = get-credential
    update-warrantyinfo -Autotask -AutotaskCredentials $creds -AutotaskAPIKey 'APIINTEGRATIONKEY' -GenerateReports

This will generate the reports in C:\Temp. To set the path yourself use

       update-warrantyinfo -Autotask -AutotaskCredentials $creds -AutotaskAPIKey 'APIINTEGRATIONKEY' -GenerateReports -ReportsLocation "C:\OtherFolder"

## NinjaOne
To update NinjaOne first you will need to create a Global Custom Field to hold your expiry date. Call this something like "Warranty Expiry", use a Date type and make a note of the field name once saved. In my case it is warrantyExpiry. Next you need to generate Ninja API Credentials. Create a new "API Services" key with "Management" and "Monitoring" Access and Client Credentials as an allowed grant type. If needed enter "Localhost" in the redirect URL. For the NinjaURL enter the Ninja URL for your instance. For example https://app.ninjarmm.com, https://eu.ninjarmm.com, etc.

         update-warrantyinfo -Ninja -NinjaClientID "YourAPIClientID" -NinjaSecret "YourAPISecret" -NinjaURL "https://eu.ninjarmm.com" -NinjaFieldName "warrantyExpiry" -SyncWithSource -OverwriteWarranty -ExcludeApple

## Hudu

To update Hudu, first edit the asset layout of the devices you wish to update to add a new field. If you wish to use expirations and not have apple devices, choose a date field and enable add to expirations. If you wish to have apple devices you will need to make this a string field and not use expirations. Make a note of the name of the field and the name of the asset layout then call the script:

        update-warrantyinfo -Hudu -HuduAPIKey "YourAPIKey" -HuduBaseURL "YourHuduDomain" -HuduDeviceAssetLayout "Desktops / Laptops" -HuduWarrantyField "Warranty Expiry" -SyncWithSource -OverwriteWarranty -ExcludeApple

## Halo PSA / ITSM / Service Desk

To update Halo you will first need to determine which field name you are using to store you serial numbers. This could be a base field such as "inventory_number", an asset field such as "Serial Number" or a custom field such as "CFSerialNumber". You can find the name by using the Halo Powershell Module and using Get-HaloAsset -FullObjects and inpecting the returned objects:

        update-warrantyinfo -Halo -HaloClientID "YourAPIAppClientID" -HaloClientSecret "YourHaloAPIAppSecret" -HaloURL "YourHaloURL" -HaloSerialField "Halo Serial Field Name" -SyncWithSource -OverwriteWarranty -ExcludeApple

To speed the script up we also recommend the following: 

Create a Column Profile in Halo that includes just the following: 

- Asset/Serial Number (inventory_number)
- Parts Warranty Start
- Parts Warranty Ends
- ProductNumber (A field required for HP Warranty checks)

Get the ID of that Column Profile and use the -columnsID switch as in the example below

        update-warrantyinfo -Halo -HaloClientID "YourAPIAppClientID" -HaloClientSecret "YourHaloAPIAppSecret" -HaloURL "YourHaloURL" -HaloSerialField "Halo Serial Field Name" -SyncWithSource -OverwriteWarranty -ExcludeApple -ColumnsID "YourColumnProfileID"

By default we have disabled the ability to resume where you have left off in the case of a failure or for some other reason.  You can enable this by using the -Resume switch as in the example below. This will make the script much slower to run, especially if you are not using a column profile

        update-warrantyinfo -Halo -HaloClientID "YourAPIAppClientID" -HaloClientSecret "YourHaloAPIAppSecret" -HaloURL "YourHaloURL" -HaloSerialField "Halo Serial Field Name" -SyncWithSource -OverwriteWarranty -ExcludeApple -ColumnsID "YourColumnProfileID" -Resume

## BluetraitIO

To execute an update of all devices in BluetraitIO use:

    update-warrantyinfo -BluetraitIO -BTAPIKEY "your_api_key" -BTAPIURL "https://example.bluetrait.io/api/" -SyncWithSource -OverwriteWarranty

# Contributions

Feel free to send pull requests or fill out issues when you encounter them. I'm also completely open to adding direct maintainers/contributors and working together! :) I'd love if we could make this into a huge help for our entire community.

# Future plans

Version 1.7 includes a new HP API that is created from a reverse engineered API by HP.
